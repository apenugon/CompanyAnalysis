              <h2 class="display-4">Who?</h2>
              <p>I decided to make this project about a company I found out about recently: <a href="http://www.ampermusic.com">Amper Music</a>. They just raised a $4M Seed round in March, and I met a founder earlier this year. But what interests me about them is they have created a platform to create AI-generated music! As an avid musician myself (and one-time aspiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhMdHOcGalI">producer</a> myself) I was hooked.</p>
              <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/ragnarok451/CompanyAnalysis">Github</a> for more information! Also, this page is loaded live every time, so you may need to wait for the graphs to load.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">What?</h2>
              <p>I was curious if I could use information online to determine something about the finances of this company. There were two sources of information that were great: WebArchive, which I used to look at the growth of their customer showcase over time to forecast revenue, and Amazon Alexa data, which I used to estimate platform usage (and therefore costs). The graph on the left depicts Amper's estimated costs and revenue to date, month over month. </p>
              <p>To estimate revenue, I estimated average deal size as about $8000, from <a href="https://www.saastr.com/a-little-less-about-pricing-a-little-more-about-deal-size-please/">here</a>. I also estimated that every customer in the showcase counted as a deal.</p>
              <p>The model I created relies on data from <a href="http://builtwith.com">BuiltWith</a> for info about their tech stack. I estimated page visits from Alexa ranking using <a href="http://netberry.co.uk/alexa-rank-explained.htm">this information</a>. I assumed that 25% of those visits could translate to an hour of platform usage, costing $0.10 on Amazon. I also used their address on their WHOIS to get real estate cost. I modelled employee cost assuming that they scaled linearly with revenue, and that the cost for each was $130k on average.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">When?</h2>
              <p>With this information, I estimated the company's available cash on hand. The graph on the right depicts the company's cash on hand over time. As we can see, cash on hand dips negative in <span id="coh"></span> months, so Amper would need to raise another round by then.</p>
